## Notes
- Additional layers of abstraction were avoided intentionally
- Priority was given to architectural structure over detailed UI design.
- The mobile design is open to interpretation, as no corresponding mockups were supplied. 

## Next steps
"What I will do, if I have more time"
- Add loadings and errors handlings
- Polish of mobile designs and adaptivity
- Add tests
- Recheck linters warnings
- Tune boilerplate, such things as linters rules and so on.
